# A little bit about my professinoal history
### I won't be going **that** far back, so to start:
<br>

## SimplePractice
* Started at SimplePractice in 2020 where I was a Product Specialist, and I was responsible for:
  - Fielding questions from customers.
  - Corresponding via email, live chat, and video calls.
  - Buidling a solid working foundation of the platform to investigate a myriad of issues that could coume up. 
  - Triage requests to the correct team, and escalate technical issues as well.
  
* From there, I moved over to the Technical Product Speciialist team in May of 2021 where I was then in charge of:
  - Investigating more Technical Issues, and validating errors and bugs found in the system.
  - Testing and documenting reproducing steps for bugs, and escalating issues to the Engineering team to be fixed.
  - Acting as liason between the Customer Success and the Engineering teams. 
  
  #### Now after a year on the Technical Product Specialist team *TPS* I've moved over to Engineering where officially I'm a Tools and Support Engineer, and I'm really looking forward to everything I'll be learning moving forward! :book:
